    analyzed natively in R or in MS Excel. The comparison analysis shows changes 
    and errors by row and column and provides summary statistics. compareDFx can 
    also compare data frames with different columns and column classes. The MS 
    Excel report is a multi-tab workbook that color codes additions, deletions, 
    and changes which can easily be used by a non-R users.
